The file "web_scraper/output.json" is a JSON file that will be generated by the web scraper after it finishes running. It's not a Python file, so it doesn't contain any Python code. Instead, it will contain the scraped data in JSON format.

However, since the web scraper hasn't run yet, this file will be empty initially. The content of this file will be dynamically generated by the web scraper during runtime.

So, an empty JSON file would look like this:

```json
[]
```
