4. Pipelines: These are defined in "pipelines.py" and are used in "settings.py" to specify the order of data processing.

5. Settings: These are defined in "settings.py" and are used in "main.py" and "website_spider.py" to configure the behavior of Scrapy and the spider.

6. Middlewares: These are defined in "middlewares.py" and are used in "settings.py" to specify the order of request/response processing.

7. Utils: This is a utility module defined in "utils.py". It can contain helper functions that are used across different files.

8. JSON: The output format is JSON, which is used in "pipelines.py" to store the scraped data.
